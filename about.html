        <div id="aboutus">
            <p>After running a successful pizza business in Calgary, Doug learned how to make people happy, one topping at a time. The menu extends beyond pizza, and we're happy to create pasta and appetitzers with excellent wine pairing recommendations. Our goal is to serve bold, amazing flavours to our community and visitors!</p>
            <p>When we're not scouring the globe (okay, the prairies) for the freshest, ripest and boldest ingredients, we're crafting unique and amazing pizzas for your and your family to enjoy. Everything at Okotoks Pizza and Pasta is made with love.</p>
            <p>Okotoks Pizzas are made with only the freshest ingredients like mozzarella, roma tomatoes, made-from-scratch sauce and even features premium toppings. You feel good about ordering it. You feel good about eating it. And you feel even better knowing we're always ready to make you more.</p>
