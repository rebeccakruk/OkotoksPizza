            <!-- label with tab index, then when we do fw, it will display. if it was a link and it was clicked, the menu would collapse, which is a problem. Solved using pointer events. When you're clicking within the menu you want the pointer events disable, but then when you're clikcing on the dropdown you want to enable the pointer events again. Now you're free to click within the menu, nothing happens, it will still close. -->
